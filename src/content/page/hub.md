## Background

Technology by Design created the platform we refer to as the Hub in order to offer visibility into processing 1115 waivers. The main goal in creation of the Hub platform is to provide a centralized place for observability and tracability of messages sent between parties to and from Technology by Design as part of the 1115 Waiver project. 

## Access

Accessing the Hub requires you to have elevated permissions in the Technology by Design ecosystem. Please request access via [this form](/submit-form/access-request) if you'd like to gain insight into the message exchange taking place as part of the 1115 Waiver project.

## Links

The Hub has multiple instances so it is important you choose the right one depending on whether you're testing or exchanging messages in a production environment. The links below will take you to each of the appropriate Hub environments.
