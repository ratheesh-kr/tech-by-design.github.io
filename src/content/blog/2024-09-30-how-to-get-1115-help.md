## Tech by Design Hub

The Tech by Design Hub is a custom developed user interface (UI) that was created to give insight into the transformation and exchange of messages sent by qualifying entities (QEs) by way of Tech by Design. The goal of the Hub is to provide anyone using this service with self-service capability and insight into what happened with their messages when they entered into the Tech by Design eco-system. The Hub has been developed "in the open" as much as possible in order to make all functionality both known and discoverable, in an effort to be transparent with the flow through the system.

Note that information is readily available via the Hub UI, but using the interface presents challenges for monitoring and alerting - as most user interfaces do. It is recommended that the QEs needing more regular insight utilize the Tech by Design Hub APIs to pull information in order to build out the reports, monitoring, or alerting that suits their business requirements most effectively.​

### Links

- There is a site that contains more information for 1115 Waiver process through the Tech by Design Hub [here](https://tech-by-design.github.io/docs.techbd.org).

- There is Swagger documentation regarding the API that can be found [here](https://synthetic.hub.devl.techbd.org//docs/swagger-ui/techbd-api).

- The Tech by Design Help Desk repository offers forum style help that is useful for QEs in this endeavor. See [this discussion](https://github.com/tech-by-design/help-desk-non-phi/discussions/19) as an example of working with a QE on getting programmatic access.​
